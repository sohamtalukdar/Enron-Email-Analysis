Davis favors tiered rate increases 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer

N30195.DTL 
Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' 
electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more 
power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. 
Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff 
members to accept a so-called structured rate system. 
Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the 
state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously 
estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt 
utilities. 
If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. 
In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' 
average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. 
Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on 
the way. 
""We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money,"" said Larry 
Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. ""We might as well admit 
that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use 
it, 
let's pay for it."" 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday 
from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he 
said, ""were wildly high."" 
""The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, 
"" Maviglio said. ""Until we know the results of the negotiations with the 
utilities, you can't conclude anything."" 
The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and 
Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion 
in debt. 
PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California 
can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the 
Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two 
companies. 
""The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall,"" 
said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. ""Either wholesale prices need to come 
down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large."" 
Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's 
energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in 
disguise for the governor. 
COST VS. OUTAGES
If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many 
consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. 
""I don't like either choice,"" said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a 
gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco 
candy store. ""But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the 
blackouts."" 
Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay 
within ""the existing rate structure"" -- a stealthy way of saying that 
January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year 
will remain in place. 
But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that 
could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. 
Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a 
minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. 
""For the good of California, it's inevitable,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive 
director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry 
association. 
Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the 
Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price 
for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. 
""It's like gasoline,"" he said. ""I don't like paying higher prices for 
gasoline, but that's the price of doing business."" 
Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. 
""If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it,"" said Tracy resident Mark 
Dougherty. ""But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling 
blackouts."" 
""I'd rather have blackouts,"" agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- 
repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. ""I don't want to pay rates 
that are so much higher."" 
NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE
This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find 
themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid 
blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their 
way. 
Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats 
this summer and beyond. 
""Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation,"" said Tom 
Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of 
Southern California Edison. 
Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve 
power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to 
do so. 
Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, 
requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. 
But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt 
widespread conservation measures. 
""It adjusts consumer behavior,"" Higgins said. ""People want to get their bills 
back down."" 
RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE
He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way 
Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the 
governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. 
""It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this,"" 
Higgins said. 
Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes 
across loud and clear: No, no, no. 
""No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, 
head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""We 
need to get back to a regulated system."" 
Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened 
to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market 
if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. 
Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance 
rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken 
seriously in Sacramento. 
""We've paid too much already,"" Rosenfield said. ""A fair price is what we were 
promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease."" 
However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured 
rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, 
Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. 
""Big users should pay more,"" he said after a moment's reflection. ""I'm open 
to a tiered system but only if it's fair."" 
Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer 
advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with 
Davis. 
MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES
Clearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power 
rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 
9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a 
three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least 
another three months, if not longer. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates 
going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. 
""I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation,"" she said. ""People 
who use a whole lot of power should pay more."" 
The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that 
California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The 
state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to 
determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. 
San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its 
energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. ""That way, you 
have more convenience and electricity, more stability,"" she said. 
But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate 
increases and rolling blackouts. 
She's moving to Texas.

To End California Power-Overcharge Case

WASHINGTON -- With settlement talks apparently stalled, a federal hearing 
officer said he may propose his own solution to settle billions in alleged 
electricity overcharges tied to the California power crisis. 
Curtis L. Wagner Jr. said he was still ""optimistic"" California officials and 
several power companies could come to terms on $8.9 billion in disputed 
electricity charges the state has incurred over the past year. 
Absent more-meaningful progress, he said he would offer his own ""preliminary 
assessment"" and recommendation as soon as today. 
In that event, Mr. Wagner also said, he would convene a hearing Monday where 
the two sides would be given the chance to comment on his plans. Mr. Wagner 
has previously indicated he feels California is due some refunds, but far 
less than the total the state claims. California is also indebted to the 
power companies for billions in previous deliveries; those debts could at 
least partially offset any refunds. Mr. Wagner has also said long-term 
contracts that would insulate the state from the sort of price shocks it has 
experienced over the past year could be part of any resolution. 
An administrative-law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
Mr. Wagner was named by the panel two weeks ago to broker a peace of the 
overcharge dispute. 
Commission officials have given the parties until Monday to reach an 
agreement behind closed doors. After that, absent a settlement, the 
commission has ordered Mr. Wagner to report back with his findings and 
recommendations within a week. 
At that point, the commission has said it will impose a settlement of its own 
liking. 
The overcharge issue has been a flash point in the California debacle, with 
the state's governor, Gray Davis, calling the energy companies ""pirates"" and 
""marauders."" 
The industry considers itself a scapegoat for a bungled state deregulation 
effort.

Financial 
California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks
Peter Behr

FINAL

Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved 
California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to 
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying 
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. 
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is 
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term 
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for 
Davis. 
""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get 
us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. 
""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you 
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" 
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a 
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close 
to the negotiations. 
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the 
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach 
a compromise. 
""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told 
reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I 
may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to 
conclude on Monday. 
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides 
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. 
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, 
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at 
sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. 
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, 
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid 
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in 
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. 
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for 
all sides, is closed to the public and media. 
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and 
his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the 
parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report 
confirmed by sources close to the talks. 
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant 
Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for 
failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers 
have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off 
various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's 
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but 
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's 
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher 
refund figure, some energy analysts believe. 
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an 
overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have 
to pay for energy under those deals. 
California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed 
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at 
volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so 
did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating 
long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so 
far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power 
for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was 
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and 
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy 
analysts say. 
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political 
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's 
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that 
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count 
as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" 
according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. 
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. 
""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said 
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" 
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the 
overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. 
""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" 
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight 
committee for the California grid. 
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room 
""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, 
sources said. "

Calpine Corp. reported net income nearly doubled in the second quarter, 
reflecting the independent power producer's aggressive plant-building 
program. Meanwhile, the parent of a San Diego utility said profit rose 25%. 
Calpine, of San Jose, Calif., said net was $107.7 million, or 32 cents a 
share, up from $59.5 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest 
results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, included a special 
charge of seven cents a share related to Calpine's purchase of Encal Energy 
Ltd., a natural-gas company. Revenue grew even more strongly, soaring to 
$1.61 billion from $417.2 million. 
Separately, Sempra Energy, parent of electric utility San Diego Gas & 
Electric, reported profit rose to $137 million from $110 million a year 
earlier. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion from $1.5 billion. Sempra 
Chairman Steve Baum attributed the growth, which stands in marked contrast to 
the financial woes of California 's other electric-utility-owning energy 
companies, to Sempra's unregulated operations. 
Calpine's profit increased despite paying substantially more for natural gas 
to fuel its plants. It spent an average of $4.80 per million British Thermal 
Units for natural gas, up from $3.31 a year before. At the same time, 
Calpine's revenue per megawatt hour of electricity sold also rose, to $71.03 
in the latest period from $64.80 a year earlier. 
At Sempra, Mr. Baum said profit from Sempra's biggest utility unit, San Diego 
Gas & Electric, fell 7.5% to $37 million from $40 million. Results were flat 
at its gas-distribution company, Southern California Gas Co. Sempra Energy 
Trading was the big profit center, generating half its total profit, or $69 
million, compared with $40 million a year earlier. 
Mr. Baum said Sempra's stock, which trades at a low price/earnings multiple 
of 10, still is being ""affected negatively by the California situation."" He 
also said the company made less money in spot-power markets than in prior 
quarters but nevertheless intends to invest $2 billion in new power plants. 
In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Calpine shares rose 
$1.08 to $36.89, while Sempra climbed 17 cents to $25.49. "

California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks

California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. 
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. 
""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" 
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. 
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. 
""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. 
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. 
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. 
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. 
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. 
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. 
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. 
California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. 
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. 
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. 
""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. 
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said. "

California Changes Stance on Refunds 
Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks 
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, July 6, 2001; Page E01 
California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to 
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity, saying 
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year.
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is 
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term 
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for 
Davis. 
""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get 
us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. 
""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you 
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion.""
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a 
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close 
to the negotiations.
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the 
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach 
a compromise.
""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told 
reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I 
may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to 
conclude on Monday.
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides 
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. 
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California's largest utility, 
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at

2.   Barton feels strongly that FERC should not be the ""tail wagging the do=

=20
3.   On particulars of the bill, they are clearly reconsidering the 40,000 =
MW minimum threshold for the size of an RTO.  They are getting pulled in bo=
th directions, they say, and are inclined to drop the 40,000 MW number -- p=
ossibly leaving it to FERC to set a number.  They conceded that the mechani=
cs of the draft make it unlikely that the 18 month ""deadline"" for all trans=
mission owners to get into an approved RTO would stick.  They consciously c=
hanged the normal judicial standard of review for FERC actions from ""arbitr=

therwise the courts will rubber stamp FERC.  Spent a lot of time on how the=
 draft would aid and abet the recalcitrant utilities and that the overall n=

 that was the truly pro forma aspect of their process since FERC's hands an=

Yesterday, Spet 19, the GISB Board of Directors voted unanimously to recharter GISB into the EISB as proposed in the Strawman Ver 2.1.  This will form the four quadrant standards setting organization.  It was recognized that each of the four quadrants would devlop on their own pace and lack of formation of any one quadrant would not inhibit the formation of EISB itself.
 
The GISB Board also recognized a comment from PJM who asked to strike out language in the Strawman 2.1 that referenced NERC and AGA as two physical reliability standards organizations.  Many electric wholesale customer, including EPSA and Enron, have argued that reliability and commercial issues are inseparable and believe there should not be artificial limits to what the wholesale electric quadrant should be able to address.  The GISB Board recognized this concern, but rather than strike the language, it was recognized that the words were only in a preamble and instructed the drafting of the new charter to not include such language.

may tie EOTT or Enron to this incident, for the reasons above, and because of 
the L.A. Times exposure, we could receive media calls about this matter.  
Scott Vonderheide has been alerted in this regard.  At this juncture, we need 
to decide where to refer any calls we receive on this matter.  Until further 
notice, I would advise that any and all such calls be referred to Cutty 
Cunningham .  Cutty, I think your response to any such calls should be that 
we did not own the truck or the oil, or employ the driver.  We should 
otherwise state that we are investigating the matter and have no further 
comment at this time.  Also, Lori and Molly,  we will need to decide very 
soon whether this matter will have any 10K significance. At the appropriate 
time, we should see what Baird thinks.  We will look to Cummings and their 
insurance carriers  to indemnify us----and be responsible for any claims 
against us by Tosco-----but we are still trying to ascertain the value of any 
such indemnity from Cummings and/ or its carriers. We don't have enough 
information at this time to speculate on the magnitude of any exposure we may 
have in this matter.  Ed Attanasio needs to confer with Susan Ralph and 
advise on this ASAP.  Please advise if there are any questions. Thanks.  SWD

162855,"Company Business, Strategy, etc.","Something is rotten with the state of Enron.
Or so Wall Street suspects. On Jan. 1, shares in Enron (news/quote), the
giant energy trading company in Houston, stood at $83.13. On Friday, Enron
closed at $31.57, down 9.7 percent for the week and 62 percent for the
year. The slide has destroyed more than $38 billion in shareholder value.
In part, the company's problems are beyond its control, a result of the
collapse in natural gas prices this year and investor fears of a coming
glut in electricity. But the deepest wound at Enron is self-inflicted.
Heavy insider selling, indecipherable accounting practices and a stream of
executive departures have combined to create a growing credibility gap
between the company and Wall Street.
""The stock is trading under a cloud,"" says James S. Chanos, the president
of Kynikos Associates, a hedge fund in New York. Mr. Chanos began betting
against Enron early this year and says he thinks that the company's shares
remain overvalued.
Enron's problems came to a head on Aug. 14, when it announced that Jeffrey
K. Skilling, the chief executive, had quit for personal reasons.
With his resignation, Mr. Skilling joined a half-dozen other top Enron
managers who have decided this year to pursue other opportunities. Still,
the news came as a surprise because Mr. Skilling was named to his post only
in February.
Under the best of circumstances, the unexpected departure of a chief
executive rattles Wall Street. But hard-headed investors can usually
comfort themselves by toting up the sales and profits that the dearly
departed pooh-bah has left behind. Executives come and go, but numbers are
forever.
Unfortunately, Enron's books offer investors little succor. The complexity
of the company's businesses and the way it reports its results make
understanding Enron's financial statements essentially impossible.
Over the last decade, Enron has transformed itself from a simple natural
gas pipeline company into the world's largest trader of electricity and
gas. Last year, about three-quarters of the company's cash flow came out of
the company's wholesale services division, which includes its trading
operations.
But Enron keeps to itself the details of the trades it makes. Are they
short-term or long-term? Is the company hedged, or does it make
""directional bets"" on the prices of the commodities it trades?
The answers are crucial, because they determine how much risk Enron has
taken to make its money. Big profits are nice. Big profits that come from
big, risky trades are a recipe for big, unexpected write-offs.
Enron also makes a habit of selling assets and securities to closely
related companies in ""related party"" transactions. The company says that
the deals are comparable to those it makes with independent buyers and that
they have been approved by its board and outside auditors.
But related-party deals can provide a convenient way for public companies
to shift losses to private affiliates. And Enron's disclosure about its
related-party deals, including billions of dollars in asset swaps with a
partnership that until recently was controlled by the company's chief
financial officer, is notably sketchy.
In the good old days, like last year, companies could get away with the
unlikeliest of accounting gimmicks, as long as their revenue and profit
numbers looked good. But Wall Street has become more demanding, as Enron is
learning to its chagrin.
Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, says the company is aware of investors'
concerns. ""We've got credibility issues on the street, no question,"" Mr.
Palmer says. ""We're looking at a lot of ways to give our investors more
information.""
Sooner would be better than later."

GAZETA: Energia , o alvo dos empres?rios americanos??BRAS?LIA, 15 de fevereiro de 2000 - Empres?rios norte-americanos que ?acompanharam o secret?rio de Com,rcio, William Daley, destacaram o setor de ?energia ?no Brasil como a principal ?rea para investimentos no Pa?s. Segundo o ?vice-presidente da Enron, Terrence Thorn, por,m, 'o monop?lio exercido pela ?Petrobras? tem que acabar para que o setor se desenvolva. Todos devem competir, ?inclusive a estatal'.?Um dos obst?culos ,, de acordo com ele, 'a sombra que a Petrobras faz sobre o ?mercado de energia no Brasil'. O executivo norte-americano lembra que a ?decis?o do governo brasileiro de estabelecer um pre?o ?nico para o g?s ?natural em todo o pa?s , um claro exemplo de medidas que devem ter seus dias ?contados. 'Ficamos confusos ao saber de tal decis?o'. Terrence Thorn acredita ?que um monop?lio estatal pode ser negativo . concorrncia e que a 
privatiza??o 
da Petrobras ter? que ocorrer um dia.
Para ele, o processo de privatiza??o de energia no Brasil vem sendo conduzido 
de forma eficaz, 'mas o Pa?s ainda n?o concluiu o projeto de desregulamenta??o
 (liberalizar o pre?o do g?s natural, por exemplo) e h? muito trabalho pela 
frente'. Segundo Thorn, as empresas estrangeiras de energia podem oferecer 
servi?os
 inovadores para o setor.
'O problema , que o mercado n?o est? preparado'. Ele defende que as novas 
fases da desregulamenta??o do setor energ,tico no Pa?s sejam debatidas por 
toda 
a sociedade.
O interesse dos norte-americanos pelo setor p""de ser visto na pr?pria 
composi??o da miss?o de empres?rios ao Brasil. Das 20 empresas que viajaram 
com
 Daley, dez eram do setor de energia. O representante da Agncia de ?Desenvolvimento e Com,rcio dos Estados Unidos (USTR), Albert Angulo, ainda ?informou? que o ?rg?o est? analisando cinco oportunidades de investimentos dos EUA no ?mercado de energia do Brasil. 'Realizamos estudos de viabilidade para que? empresa venham ao Pa?s, mas o certo , que uma maior desregulamenta??o do ?setor energ,tico seria muito positivo para as empresas norte-americanas', diz.?A vice-presidente da empresa Energy Conversion Devices, Nancy Bacon, defende ?que o governo brasileiro deixe de gastar recursos com a gera??o de energia ?em locais distantes e passe a comprar tecnologias alternativas dos ?norte-americanos.

transmission rights); (ii) posting of ATC, TTC, and CBM; and (ii) seams 
issues between RTOs (transmission service across multiple RTOs).  FERC says 
that the new OASIS should make use of Internet, interactive displays, etc.  
FERC also asks for information on dynamic notification (where the OASIS 
automatically alerts the customer to changes in ATC, reservations, etc.)  
This type of functionality would allow Enron to determine if it wants to stay 
in a queue when transmission becomes available (rather than getting kicked 
out after the first denial for lack of ATC.)  FERC also wants information on 
whether generator-run status should be included on OASIS; electronic 
scheduling (which can now be done via etag); and business practices that 
should be standardized.
Enron could have significant input to force these utilities to propose a 
good, customer friendly system that provides valid and helpful data on ATC, 
TTC, and CBM, rather than the total lack of substantive information that is 
available today.  (Recall that Enron proposed that CBM use be posted--FERC 
has not adopted that idea yet.)
Because these are critical utilities, any system that they propose may be 
very likely to be adopted (with some changes).  I think it is better to be in 
on the front end.  Enron's participation would also give validity to their 
system.
Dan Larcamp told me that he would like more ""classes"" for his staff from 
Enron and that we should give joint classes with AEP because Susan Tomasky 
told Dan L. that ""AEP has nothing to hide.""  This type of venture would allow 
AEP one venue to make good on that statement.
Steve K. asked us to pursue the idea that Enron build a computer system.  
This may be a good way to have significant input while leveraging these 
companies' money and promoting Enron's congestion model ideas, etc.

> A 1960 Moment
> Al Gore's selection of Joe Lieberman gives Democrats--and everyone
> else--something to cheer about.
> BY PEGGY NOONAN
> Monday August 7, 2000 4:26 p.m. EDT
> The choice of Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as Al Gore's running mate is so
> smart, so clever, so good, so satisfying, so striking that it just may
> turn
> this election a bit on its head for a while. Certainly its most immediate
> effect is going to be a successful Democratic convention next week in Los
> Angeles, because now the Democrats, badly hit by their own form of Clinton
> fatigue and acutely aware of the particular charmlessness of their
> presidential candidate, have something to cheer about. They respect Joe
> Lieberman. They think he has a center, a moral and ethical view of the
> world. He is experienced and articulate. He is decent and intelligent. He
> is
> independent. The media love him. He is a regular co-star on Imus, and all
> of
> the columnists and reporters for the elite newspapers, and all of the
> electronic pundits and anchors, know him and admire him.
> But that is not what is most wonderful. What is most wonderful is that he
> is
> an Orthodox Jew. What does this mean? It means a lot of people who love
> America more than they love parties or politics are happy that a big and
> great breakthrough has occurred. A friend, a journalist who is politically
> conservative and Jewish, e-mailed me to tell me he had been weeping all
> morning, that he'd cried when he heard the news. Another friend, a
> producer at a TV news show, called and told me she woke her father in
> California to give him the news and they both got choked up. ""This is like
> 1960,"" she said, and I said I know, and I got choked up. It is wonderful
> when America is at her most American, and breaks down another barrier and
> says ""What's in your heart is most important.""
> If Joe Lieberman had been Joe Lee, and an Episcopalian, Al Gore would have
> been smart to pick him. He would have been an obvious choice. The only
> reason he would have hesitated over Mr. Lieberman is that he's Jewish. Mr.
> Gore decided that was just fine. I think that I have never seen Al Gore do
> such an elegant, intelligent and original thing. Well done, Mr. Gore.
> I have to tell you, this really does feel like a 1960 moment to me. I was
> a
> little girl when a Catholic got chosen to run for president, and I had
> gathered from the conversation of grownups that You Don't Elect Catholics
> to the Presidency. When it happened, it's hard to describe how exciting
> and
> moving and idealism-inspiring it was. It gave a lot of people a lot of
> joy.
> It opened things up more. That was a good thing. So is this.
> And because this is such a good thing, I hope everyone of whatever
> politics
> or persuasion sits back for a few days and feels good about it. Everyone
> should be nice and not do any political bashing until . . . Friday.
> However, I think it's okay and maybe even helpful to note the following.
> Network producers are going to decide, in their bright and touchingly
> uninformed minds, that the big opponents of the Lieberman choice will be
> Christian conservatives. That's where they'll go for the negative sound
> bites. But Christian conservatives love Joe Lieberman. They've been arm in
> arm with him in the great cultural battles of the past decade. He was just
> about the only Democrat who'd give them the time of day. He was on their
> side.
> The last time I saw Mr. Lieberman was last spring, in New York, at a
> symposium on Hollywood and the culture. I moderated and introduced our
> guests--Joe Lieberman and Bill Bennett, who are close friends and
> co-warriors in the values battle. Lieberman and Bennett very frankly
> talked
> to the audience of producers and writers and network people and movie
> stars about how to make television and film and music more decent, more
> helpful.
> This is how people on the right think of and have experienced Mr.
> Lieberman--as a good guy with his head screwed on right.
> Many conservative Christians--I think most conservative Christians--see
> all
> of those who love God as part of the same ""cultural minority.""
> Conservative
> Christians don't feel they have much in common, in terms of their
> political
> desires, with atheists and agnostics and leftist Episcopalian bishops and
> such. But they think they have a great deal in common with Orthodox Jews.
> They crowd around Rabbi Daniel Lapin when he speaks at a conservative
> gathering; they crowd around Dennis Prager, Michael Medved, David Horowitz
> and scores of others. One of the biggest heroes of conservative Christians
> is an Orthodox Jew called Dr. Laura; the last time I saw her she was
> wowing them at a born-again Christian assembly at the National Prayer
> Breakfast last February.
> A powerful and respected political officeholder told me Monday that
> there's
> ""no upside"" to the Lieberman choice. I told him there's no downside. He
> was surprised and said, ""He can't even campaign on Saturdays!"" I said so
> what, America would love to see a politician who actually put God first
> one day a week.
> I wish I'd added this: Remember Sandy Koufax? Joe Lieberman not
> campaigning on Saturday is Sandy Koufax not pitching on Yom Kippur. There
> were a lot of great sports moments in the 1950s and 1960s, but none
> greater than the day in 1965 when Mr. Koufax put God before the World
> Series. What a great guy, what a lesson for a generation of Christian and
> Jewish kids. And Muslims and everyone else too.
> Yes, it's good news for Hillary. It's great news for Hillary. It enlivens
> part of her New York base, it says to New York Jews that the Democrats are
> the party that did this great thing, it excites people--and may help them
> forget, or at least not remember so vividly, that the Democratic
> senatorial
> candidate has, shall we say, a not fully satisfying relationship with New
> York's Jews. A historic choice like the Mr. Lieberman can overwhelm a lot
> of
> previous bad static.
> But let's not care about that for now. The headline is not ""Is It Good for
> Hillary?"" The headline is: ""It Is Good for America."" It is a wonderful
> country that does something like this, that takes a good man who is a
> member of a small ethnic/religious minority to be one of its two major
> vice
> presidential candidates, and that greets that choice with resounding
> hurrahs.

said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are 
tripling.  Frankly, we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else.  But he 
also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.  Enron and others 
had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E 
(which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched.  
California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a 
deferral account).  I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't 
protect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the market 
based solutions.  One of the messages in my testimony will be: customers 
should be encouraged to choose.  Those who did are doing fine."

1.  I have spoken with Gavyn and asked him to add to his usual review

2.  I have asked Bill Kristol to do the same.
3.  I have asked Paul Portney to review ""the lay of the land"" in the

4.  Since we couldn't locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron, 
now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the 
best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief 
talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on 
this subject.
5.  I couldn't get anyone on the ""monopoly-too-big-and-powerful"" question, 
although I am still trying.
I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply

175849,"Company Business, Strategy, etc.","SACRAMENTO -- Legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce 
about 30 percent of the state's power have agreed to cut their power prices 
in half, an important step toward easing the electricity crisis. 
Negotiations continued on what Gov. Gray Davis has called the final step: the 
state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investor-owned 
utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt. 
Meanwhile, the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the 
customers of the utilities grows. Officials gave notice that an additional 
$500 million will be needed in 10 days, bringing the total to $2.6 billion. 
But for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert 
yesterday due to power shortages. More power was available from other states, 
and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed 
operation. 
Two legislators, Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, 
D-Boulder Creek, said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the 
prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations. 
""Ultimately, this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its 
ratepayers by billions of dollars,"" said Battin, who represents eastern San 
Diego County. 
About half of the small generators use ""renewable"" technologies such as 
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. The rest is ""co-generation,"" when fuel 
is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a by-product. 
The small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of California's 
power under a two-decade-old federal ""qualifying facilities"" program, which 
requires utilities to buy their power. 
Battin and Keeley said that under the bill, SB 47X, the average price for 
these QF contracts could drop from the current 17 cents per kilowatt-hour to 
about 8 to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
""We believe that the rates are at least that low, if not lower,"" said Jan 
Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, which 
represents small and large generators. 
The small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable 
price for five years, avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state 
regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut. 
Much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the 
California border, which has soared this winter. The legislation spreads the 
price bench mark over a five-year period. 
""We encourage the Legislature to take quick action to approve SB 47X as 
quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis,"" Smutny-Jones 
said. 
He said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a 
portfolio of long-term contracts to purchase natural gas for some 
co-generators, lowering their production costs. 
The legislation was applauded as ""a major step forward"" by a group of small 
generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take 
the utilities into bankruptcy. 
""We call on the Legislature and the governor to act on it immediately,"" said 
Chris Thompson, a spokesman for the group. 
Thompson said Southern California Edison continues to collect money from 
ratepayers, as the state buys power for its customers, but is not paying 
anything to the small non-polluting generators. 
A spokesman for a geothermal generator in El Centro, which filed a lawsuit 
seeking $45 million from Edison for power provided since November, welcomed 
the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power. 
But Vince Signorotti, a spokesman for CalEnergy, said it would be ""premature"" 
to consider dropping the lawsuit. 
Battin and Keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the 
governor's attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of 
Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric in exchange 
for payment of their debt. 
As part of the governor's plan, the utilities would agree to provide low-cost 
power for five to 10 years from their generators, which provide about a third 
of the state's power. 
Davis aides are attempting to negotiate long-term contracts with generators 
for the remaining third of the power required by the state, sharply reducing 
the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market. 
But the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign 
long-term contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for 
previous power purchases. 
The state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since 
mid-January, rescinding a Stage 1 alert declared Wednesday. Grid operators 
made the change after increased power supplies became available. 
""The supply situation this week has gradually been improving,"" said Lorie 
O'Donley, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator, 
which manages most of the state's power supplies. 
However, she said the improvements shouldn't deter consumers from 
conservation. 
""It is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to 
remind everybody that we are looking at a long-term power supply situation 
here,"" she said. ""And the high-demand summer is just around the corner. So we 
would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts."" 
In San Francisco yesterday, state power regulators decided unanimously that 
the Department of Water Resources is responsible for buying any power that 
cash-strapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own -- no 
matter what price wholesalers are charging. 
But the PUC voted 3-2 against taking action that would have allowed the DWR 
to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover 
the cost of buying electricity. 
The state, through the DWR, was authorized by a recent law to buy power for 
the utilities. Edison and PG&E have such low credit ratings that no power 
companies will sell to them. SDG&E's rating is much better, but its debt also 
was mounting. 
The DWR purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities 
provide through their own generating plants and through existing long-term 
contracts. But the DWR has refused to buy power beyond a certain price. That 
means more last-minute power purchases on the expensive spot market. 
The utilities and the state had disagreed over how the DWR will be reimbursed 
-- whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars -- and the extent of its 
power-buying role. 
The author of the bill authorizing the long-term contracts, Assemblyman 
Keeley, said the legislation's intent was to fully cover the one-third of the 
power that utilities purchased on the spot market, either through extended 
contracts or through the state ISO.

Subject:  Confidential Information and Securities Trading
 
To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading 
activities, Enron Wholesale Services (""EWS"") has recently revised its 
official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and 
Securities Trading (""Policies and Procedures""). These revisions reflect two 
major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into 
the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow 
process, the ""Review Team"" will play a more centralized role, so that the 
role of the ""Resource Group"" is no longer necessary.You are required to 
become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The 
newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on 
LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale 
Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access 
LegalOnline:
 
http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp
 
If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures 
during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although 
you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised 
Policies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the 
Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so 
within two weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will 
allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with

176564,"Company Business, Strategy, etc.","On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and 
then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why that 
makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most 
efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive 
from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic 
regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the 
business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relied 
upon to ""regulate"" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as 
distribution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to 
set pricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters 
a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for 
lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign 
contributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policies 
simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  The 
generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively 
low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of the 
power and gas business can be ""regulated"" by the market with respect to rates 
and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any more than 
grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other ""retailers"" 
(who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Competition 
and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of 
service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for 
such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign 
contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the 
legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale.
As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading 
in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be 
perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents 
have a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim 
of ""ignorance or mistake"" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise 
of ""prosecutorial discretion"".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is 
necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific 
reference to ""ignorance or mistake"", and not plead for the favorable 
esxercise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps 
we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue 
a claim under such circumstances."

176775,"Company Business, Strategy, etc.","SACRAMENTO -- Legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce 
about 30 percent of the state's power have agreed to cut their power prices 
in half, an important step toward easing the electricity crisis. 
Negotiations continued on what Gov. Gray Davis has called the final step: the 
state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investor-owned 
utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt. 
Meanwhile, the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the 
customers of the utilities grows. Officials gave notice that an additional 
$500 million will be needed in 10 days, bringing the total to $2.6 billion. 
But for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert 
yesterday due to power shortages. More power was available from other states, 
and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed 
operation. 
Two legislators, Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, 
D-Boulder Creek, said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the 
prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations. 
""Ultimately, this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its 
ratepayers by billions of dollars,"" said Battin, who represents eastern San 
Diego County. 
About half of the small generators use ""renewable"" technologies such as 
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. The rest is ""co-generation,"" when fuel 
is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a by-product. 
The small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of California's 
power under a two-decade-old federal ""qualifying facilities"" program, which 
requires utilities to buy their power. 
Battin and Keeley said that under the bill, SB 47X, the average price for 
these QF contracts could drop from the current 17 cents per kilowatt-hour to 
about 8 to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
""We believe that the rates are at least that low, if not lower,"" said Jan 
Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, which 
represents small and large generators. 
The small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable 
price for five years, avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state 
regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut. 
Much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the 
California border, which has soared this winter. The legislation spreads the 
price bench mark over a five-year period. 
""We encourage the Legislature to take quick action to approve SB 47X as 
quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis,"" Smutny-Jones 
said. 
He said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a 
portfolio of long-term contracts to purchase natural gas for some 
co-generators, lowering their production costs. 
The legislation was applauded as ""a major step forward"" by a group of small 
generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take 
the utilities into bankruptcy. 
""We call on the Legislature and the governor to act on it immediately,"" said 
Chris Thompson, a spokesman for the group. 
Thompson said Southern California Edison continues to collect money from 
ratepayers, as the state buys power for its customers, but is not paying 
anything to the small non-polluting generators. 
A spokesman for a geothermal generator in El Centro, which filed a lawsuit 
seeking $45 million from Edison for power provided since November, welcomed 
the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power. 
But Vince Signorotti, a spokesman for CalEnergy, said it would be ""premature"" 
to consider dropping the lawsuit. 
Battin and Keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the 
governor's attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of 
Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric in exchange 
for payment of their debt. 
As part of the governor's plan, the utilities would agree to provide low-cost 
power for five to 10 years from their generators, which provide about a third 
of the state's power. 
Davis aides are attempting to negotiate long-term contracts with generators 
for the remaining third of the power required by the state, sharply reducing 
the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market. 
But the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign 
long-term contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for 
previous power purchases. 
The state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since 
mid-January, rescinding a Stage 1 alert declared Wednesday. Grid operators 
made the change after increased power supplies became available. 
""The supply situation this week has gradually been improving,"" said Lorie 
O'Donley, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator, 
which manages most of the state's power supplies. 
However, she said the improvements shouldn't deter consumers from 
conservation. 
""It is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to 
remind everybody that we are looking at a long-term power supply situation 
here,"" she said. ""And the high-demand summer is just around the corner. So we 
would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts."" 
In San Francisco yesterday, state power regulators decided unanimously that 
the Department of Water Resources is responsible for buying any power that 
cash-strapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own -- no 
matter what price wholesalers are charging. 
But the PUC voted 3-2 against taking action that would have allowed the DWR 
to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover 
the cost of buying electricity. 
The state, through the DWR, was authorized by a recent law to buy power for 
the utilities. Edison and PG&E have such low credit ratings that no power 
companies will sell to them. SDG&E's rating is much better, but its debt also 
was mounting. 
The DWR purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities 
provide through their own generating plants and through existing long-term 
contracts. But the DWR has refused to buy power beyond a certain price. That 
means more last-minute power purchases on the expensive spot market. 
The utilities and the state had disagreed over how the DWR will be reimbursed 
-- whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars -- and the extent of its 
power-buying role. 
The author of the bill authorizing the long-term contracts, Assemblyman 
Keeley, said the legislation's intent was to fully cover the one-third of the 
power that utilities purchased on the spot market, either through extended 
contracts or through the state ISO.

177183,"Company Business, Strategy, etc.","SACRAMENTO -- Legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce 
about 30 percent of the state's power have agreed to cut their power prices 
in half, an important step toward easing the electricity crisis. 
Negotiations continued on what Gov. Gray Davis has called the final step: the 
state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investor-owned 
utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt. 
Meanwhile, the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the 
customers of the utilities grows. Officials gave notice that an additional 
$500 million will be needed in 10 days, bringing the total to $2.6 billion. 
But for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert 
yesterday due to power shortages. More power was available from other states, 
and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed 
operation. 
Two legislators, Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, 
D-Boulder Creek, said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the 
prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations. 
""Ultimately, this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its 
ratepayers by billions of dollars,"" said Battin, who represents eastern San 
Diego County. 
About half of the small generators use ""renewable"" technologies such as 
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. The rest is ""co-generation,"" when fuel 
is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a by-product. 
The small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of California's 
power under a two-decade-old federal ""qualifying facilities"" program, which 
requires utilities to buy their power. 
Battin and Keeley said that under the bill, SB 47X, the average price for 
these QF contracts could drop from the current 17 cents per kilowatt-hour to 
about 8 to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
""We believe that the rates are at least that low, if not lower,"" said Jan 
Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, which 
represents small and large generators. 
The small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable 
price for five years, avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state 
regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut. 
Much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the 
California border, which has soared this winter. The legislation spreads the 
price bench mark over a five-year period. 
""We encourage the Legislature to take quick action to approve SB 47X as 
quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis,"" Smutny-Jones 
said. 
He said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a 
portfolio of long-term contracts to purchase natural gas for some 
co-generators, lowering their production costs. 
The legislation was applauded as ""a major step forward"" by a group of small 
generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take 
the utilities into bankruptcy. 
""We call on the Legislature and the governor to act on it immediately,"" said 
Chris Thompson, a spokesman for the group. 
Thompson said Southern California Edison continues to collect money from 
ratepayers, as the state buys power for its customers, but is not paying 
anything to the small non-polluting generators. 
A spokesman for a geothermal generator in El Centro, which filed a lawsuit 
seeking $45 million from Edison for power provided since November, welcomed 
the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power. 
But Vince Signorotti, a spokesman for CalEnergy, said it would be ""premature"" 
to consider dropping the lawsuit. 
Battin and Keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the 
governor's attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of 
Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric in exchange 
for payment of their debt. 
As part of the governor's plan, the utilities would agree to provide low-cost 
power for five to 10 years from their generators, which provide about a third 
of the state's power. 
Davis aides are attempting to negotiate long-term contracts with generators 
for the remaining third of the power required by the state, sharply reducing 
the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market. 
But the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign 
long-term contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for 
previous power purchases. 
The state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since 
mid-January, rescinding a Stage 1 alert declared Wednesday. Grid operators 
made the change after increased power supplies became available. 
""The supply situation this week has gradually been improving,"" said Lorie 
O'Donley, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator, 
which manages most of the state's power supplies. 
However, she said the improvements shouldn't deter consumers from 
conservation. 
""It is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to 
remind everybody that we are looking at a long-term power supply situation 
here,"" she said. ""And the high-demand summer is just around the corner. So we 
would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts."" 
In San Francisco yesterday, state power regulators decided unanimously that 
the Department of Water Resources is responsible for buying any power that 
cash-strapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own -- no 
matter what price wholesalers are charging. 
But the PUC voted 3-2 against taking action that would have allowed the DWR 
to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover 
the cost of buying electricity. 
The state, through the DWR, was authorized by a recent law to buy power for 
the utilities. Edison and PG&E have such low credit ratings that no power 
companies will sell to them. SDG&E's rating is much better, but its debt also 
was mounting. 
The DWR purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities 
provide through their own generating plants and through existing long-term 
contracts. But the DWR has refused to buy power beyond a certain price. That 
means more last-minute power purchases on the expensive spot market. 
The utilities and the state had disagreed over how the DWR will be reimbursed 
-- whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars -- and the extent of its 
power-buying role. 
The author of the bill authorizing the long-term contracts, Assemblyman 
Keeley, said the legislation's intent was to fully cover the one-third of the 
power that utilities purchased on the spot market, either through extended 
contracts or through the state ISO.

Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:

Vince,
 
Henwood is in the process of developing a new  product that, for lack of a better name, we are calling Market Stack.  The  purpose is to allow traders to utilize the load and supply data in EMSS without  the hassle of a full-blown simulation.  The software would be designed to  allow traders to develop a market (or supply) stack with a minimum number of  keystrokes.  The stacks could be developed for a utility, transarea, or  region, would contain load data, and would be capable of incorporating real-time  information to provide fundamental insight and market advantage.   
 
At this point in the process we are looking for  ideas (and sponsors).  If you think your traders might be open to the idea,  I would like to talk to you and them about it, and potentially as early as next  week.
 
Please advise.

FERC ALJ Says California Power Refunds Likely
    The FERC administrative law judge, who is overseeing refund settlement =
talks in California's power market, says that generators that sold electric=
ity in the state will probably have to pay back overcharges of several bill=
ion dollars. However, one would have to be paid in the first place before a=
nyone could repay anything. The ALJ says California's claim the state is ow=
ed $9 billion is too high. Enron, Mirant, Duke, Williams, Reliant Energy, a=
nd Dynegy are among the producers that FERC could compel to make the refund=
s. The companies have said they did nothing wrong. The California PUC and t=
he utilities will join in the negotiations at FERC headquarters in Washingt=
on. If no agreement is reached, the ALJ will have 7 days to make a recommen=
dation to the 5 FERC commissioners on the refund issue.=20

California Senate Hears Allegations Against Duke
     Three former Southern California power plant employees gave testimony =
on Friday to a state Senate committee investigating alleged price manipulat=
ion. Allegations against Duke Energy, as the plant's operator, included thr=
owing out spare parts to prolong the time a unit was out of service and ram=
ping electricity output up and down to manipulate power prices. Duke denied=
 the latest allegations by former workers at its South Bay power plant, say=
ing it finds the charges disturbing and incredible. Duke says the time has =
come for it to take a stand against this daily barrage of misinformation. C=
alifornia has for months been accusing the Duke and other generators who pu=
rchased many of the state's power plants of taking advantage of a chronic s=
hortage of electricity and price gouging. The governor is demanding $9 bill=
ion in refunds, and numerous lawsuits have been filed. The rhetoric has esc=
alated into branding  the generators as pirates and even murderers and rapi=
sts of the California economy, most of which is a smokescreen to hide their=
 true agenda, the forced donation of power to the state.  When Duke took ov=
er the Southern California plant they kept on all of its employees for 2 ye=
ars under an operating agreement. Once that agreement expired, Duke hired a=
bout 80% of the staff. The 3 that testified were among those not offered jo=

Subject:  Confidential Information and Securities Trading
 
To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading activities, Enron Wholesale Services (""EWS"") has recently revised its official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and Securities Trading (""Policies and Procedures"").

The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department.  Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:

   A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN                                                 
                                                                                
   NEW YORK (DOW JONES)--THE CALIFORNIA SENATE IN SACRAMENTO PASSED A           
WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX ON SALES OF ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATE'S WHOLESALE         
ELECTRICITY MARKET MONDAY AFTERNOON AT 4:50 P.M. PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME
TIME, CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE
FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH.                                                         
   COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY, BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED.              
   ""THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE      
ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE,"" SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY
OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH.                                  
   THIS WEEK'S WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED 
WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. GOV. GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN  
                                                                          (CONT)
MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE'S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY. THE
MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT, AND THE GENERATORS WEREN'T IMPRESSED.            
   AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS, RELIANT ENERGY'S (REI) JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF 
THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA, IT WOULD ""INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE   
GENERATION IN THE STATE.""                                                       
   THE STATE'S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS   
POINT. CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY
HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO.    
SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN, AND NOBODY HAS PROVED
OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES (WMB) FOR 
ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT.                                
   ""IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME, INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN   
CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEN, AFTER YOU  
BEAT THEM, THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED,"" SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER.            
   ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES, THE ISO AND NOW THE    
                                                                          (CONT)
STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR  
BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE, BUT THOSE WHO   
INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND: THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE 
IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO. OBVIOUSLY, PRICE CAPS HAVEN'T     
WORKED, JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME.                   
   IN FACT, PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE     
WRONG DISEASE. AT BEST, PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES. CALIFORNIA'S    
PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES. IT CAN'T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME,  
LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE.         
   CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED. THE      
INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER-BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO, 
AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND   
THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER. THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS 
AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN'T EXACTLY IBM'S ""BIG BLUE"" VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV.   
   ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES' HUMAN TRADERS COULD 
                                                                          (CONT)
HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE
UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW.                                    
   SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING, THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED  
BY HUMANS, BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF   
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER     
EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO, AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH  
NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM, FOR       
EXAMPLE, IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO   
TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB.                                    
   AS ONE ISO EMPLOYEE WAS WONT TO SAY: ""IT'S LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME     
BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND ST. MARY'S SCHOOL FOR UNWED MOTHERS.""                    
   AND THE SIGNING OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIVE- AND 10-YEAR CONTRACTS
IS BEING EXECUTED MAINLY BY FORMER EXECUTIVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -   
PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE UTILITY YEARS AGO TO BECOME CONSULTANTS AND ALSO DON'T HAVE
TRADING EXPERIENCE.                                                             
   GOOD IDEAS, MEANWHILE, HAVE LANGUISHED.                                (CONT)
   ""WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL METERS IN EVERY MAJOR COMMERCIAL CONCERN IN THE     
STATE THIS SUMMER AND GO TO REAL-TIME PRICING,"" DAVIS TOLD WALL STREET ANALYSTS 
ON FEB. 28.                                                                     
   THAT PROPOSAL WAS GREETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA    
FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO DATE.                                             
   WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO REAL-TIME PRICING FOR CALIFORNIA'S BIG BUSINESSES SINCE 
THEN? NOTHING.                                                                  
   ""THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA IS 'SPECIAL',"" SAID STANFORD    
ECONOMIST AND CALIFORNIA ISO CONSULTANT FRANK WOLAK. EVERY INDUSTRY FROM OIL    
REFINERS TO INTERNET SERVER FARMS HAS HAD LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO SUCCESSFULLY  
SECURING EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE.                                                
   ""MY POINT HAS BEEN THAT IF WHAT THEY DO IS SO VALUABLE, THEN THEY SHOULD BE  
ABLE TO HANDLE THE HIGHER PRICES. BUSINESSES WITH ABOUT 10,000 MEGAWATTS OF LOAD
HAVE REAL-TIME METERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE GETTING MARKET PRICES,"" SAID 
WOLAK.

   ONE OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGES THAT SELLERS OF ELECTRICITY TO CALIFORNIA HAVE
HAD IS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE FIXED PRICES, SO DEMAND IS INFLEXIBLE. SELLERS KNOW  
EXACTLY HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY THE UTILITIES MUST BUY BASED ON TEMPERATURES AND   
THE TIME OF DAY, WOLAK SAYS, AND THEY SIMPLY SUPPLY THE MARKET JUST ENOUGH POWER
AT HIGH MARGINAL PRICES.                                                        
   REDUCING OVERALL CONSUMPTION THROUGH HIGHER RATES WILL HELP THE STATE SOME,  
BUT MAKING 25% OF DEMAND FLEXIBLE BASED ON PRICE WOULD GIVE THE STATE A FIGHTING
CHANCE IN THE MARKET, ACCORDING TO WOLAK.                                       
   BUT THAT, APPARENTLY, IS TOO COMPLICATED OR POLITICALLY DIFFICULT. PRICE     
CAPS, A WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX AND POLITICAL PATRONAGE JOBS FOR BUYING BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS OF POWER MAY NOT SAVE THE STATE FROM BANKRUPTCY, BUT THEY ARE EASIER TO 
SELL - OR SLIP THROUGH - IN SACRAMENTO.

62637,"Company Business, Strategy, etc.","Adding Enron's ""negative CTC claim"" to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim).
Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway)."

We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets."

Candidly, this wouldn't have been my approach  (posh location, closed format, odd group, seemingly self-serving agenda).  
 
I read the article below  as unsympatheticand almost  mocking in its tonetoward Enron.  It's  noteworthy theBeverly Hills meeting was not covered in the Los Angeles  papers.  Instead, this article comes fromthe front page of the Bay Area's San Francisco Chronicle (Democratic bastion and  home to both of California's United States Senators, power broker Willie Brown,  Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the state's public utility commission).  
 
Consistent with myconcern about a ""coast-to-coast  firestorm""engulfing Enron, the New York  Times ran two articles today that were  unsupportiveof the  company.
 
q        Senator Calls  for Hearings Into Energy Regulators' Moves
By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS
Senator  Dianne Feinstein called for hearings into possible improprieties between members  of the F.E.R.C. and private energy interests.
 
q        Enron's  Dispute With Utility in India Grows More Tangled
By SARITHA RAI
The  dispute between the Enron Corporation and Indian federal and state government  officials keeps getting messier.
 
These follow the Times'  tough piece on Ken Lay yesterday.   Undoubtedly, the Washington Post will have to get into fray  soon.
 
My feeling is that just as  with the ""business"" side, Enron's public policy strategy needs be well informed,  sophisticated and comprehensive.  I  fear that anything less will fuel the potential of undesirable outcomes for  Enron's reputation, leadership and shareholdervalue.

Enron's secret bid to save deregulation 
PRIVATE  MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians  Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur,  Chronicle Staff Writers 
Saturday, May 26, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/05/26/MN209410.DTL   
Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly courted  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other luminaries  this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to California's  energy crisis.  
His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and  federal investigations and less rather than more regulation.  
Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign  contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at the  Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday.  
Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham  Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 1990  and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star  Schwarzenegger;  
and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been  courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.  
One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified,  said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support  Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the  state's energy mess.  
PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION
The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is  concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power  markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government authority  to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create  and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and run power plants in  California.  
""They're trying to rescue deregulation,"" the source said of Enron  executives. ""They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea.""  
At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position paper  titled ""Comprehensive Solution for California,"" which was obtained by The  Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in  debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that investigations of power  price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse.  
The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway  electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power  generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by  regulators and economists.  
One of the talking points read: ""Get deregulation right this time --  California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers."" Another  point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity.  
INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS
Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and  was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a  competitive power market system.  
Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially  produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from  generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this year,  Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.  
Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for  Enron, said she would ""look into that"" and then did not return repeated  telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at the  meeting.  
D.C. CONNECTIONS
Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached  unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times, Lay  supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating  the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story also said Lay  essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not support Lay's desire  to further deregulate the nation's electricity system. Lay denied the  allegation.  
Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief  executive of home builder Kaufman & Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of  Occidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant  Amgen.  
Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles  Lakers star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton  supporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's  first civilian space trip.  
Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but  declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment  through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon.  
A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor  attended,  
but was ""not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this  issue.  
His intent is to listen to all sides.""  
Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to  Davis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support  Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source who  participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and  asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his agenda.

7972,"Company Business, Strategy, etc.","Companies pushed up price of power -- After months of investigation,  state regulators say they have evidence suggesting that power companies have  deliberately driven up wholesale electricity prices. Now they must decide  whether those companies have done anything illegal. State Attorney General Bill  Lockyer said Thursday he believes the evidence ``strongly suggests'' power  companies acted illegally to drive up prices. He has said that he would love to  put top energy executives in jail. Brandon  Bailey and Chris O'Brien in the San Jose  Mercury  -- 5/25/01 
Davis blackout warnings -- a significant policy change aimed  at minimizing business and consumer disruptions, Gov. Gray Davis ordered state  officials Thursday to enact a three-tier blackout warning system. Forecasts of  blackouts will be issued 48 hours beforehand, Davis said. General areas will be  identified in warnings issued 24 hours before likely outages. Precise locations  will be announced an hour before the power is cut, he said. Dan Morain and Nancy  Vogel in the Los Angeles  Times  Greg Lucas and Lynda Gledhill in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Noam Levey and  Dion Nissenbaum in the San Jose  Mercury  John Hill in the Sacramento  Bee  Ed Mendel in the San  Diego Union  Robert Garrett in the Riverside  Press  Michael Coit in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5/25/01 
Davis' popularity plunges in poll -- With California's energy crisis  mounting, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suffered a precipitous fall in his job  approval rating and image among state residents, according to a Field Poll  released yesterday. For the first time since his November 1998 election, more  Californians have an unfavorable view of Davis' performance than favorable.  Carla Marinucci in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Hallye Jordan in the  San Jose  Mercury  John Marelius in the San  Diego Union  -- 5/25/01 
Poll puts Riordan, Davis in tight race -- Californians' assessment of Gov.  Gray Davis has plummeted drastically as he has struggled to handle the state  energy crisis, placing outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in a virtual  dead heat with him for the 2002 governor's race, according to a Field Poll  released Thursday. Though Riordan has given no clear indication that he intends  to run for governor, 42 percent of registered voters said they would support the  Republican mayor should he challenge Davis, the Democratic incumbent.  Forty-three percent said they would vote for Davis. Emily  Bazar in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
California to gain from GOP's loss -- A single party switch in the Senate  on Thursday handed California's Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara  Boxer new clout with key leadership roles likely on issues ranging from military  base closings to environmental cleanups. Vermont Sen. James Jeffords'  announcement that he was quitting the Republican Party to be an independent  affiliated with Democrats set up a takeover in which the Democrats, with a de  facto 51-49 majority, will assume all Senate leadership posts and committee  chairs. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
PUC and 'baseline' rates -- Nine days after structuring the  largest electricity rate increase in California history, state regulators on  Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine  how much each residential customer will pay. If the indicators are revised  upward, as most expect, that would grant some customers relief from the rate  hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power  purchases. Tim Reiterman in the Los Angeles  Times  Michael Bazeley in the San Jose  Mercury  Carrie Peyton in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Enron Bush  -- Curtis H?bert Jr., Washington's top electricity regulator, said he had barely  settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone  conversation with Kenneth L. Lay, the head of the nation's largest electricity  trader, the Enron Corporation. Mr. H?bert, chairman of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, said that Mr. Lay, a close friend of President Bush's,  offered him a deal: If he changed his views on electricity deregulation, Enron  would continue to support him in his new job. Lowell  Bergman and Jeff Gerth in the New York Times   -- 5/25/01 
Lockyer comes out swinging at oilman Davis has plenty of company in  depths of poll --  The reaction from Gov. Gray Davis' camp to yesterday's poll showing him in the  dumper was quick and blunt. ""Tell me something I don't already know,"" adviser  Paul Maslin said after being hit with the news that the latest Field Poll showed  Davis' job rating down 18 points since January. ""None of this is news to us,""  Maslin said. Matier & Ross in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Water and power -- The California Public Utilities Commission authorized an increase in  American States Water Co.'s rates at the Bear Valley Electric customer service  area of its Southern California Water Co. unit to recover $2.4 million in  deferred electric power costs. The amount will be recovered from customers over  a five-year period. Sam Favate; Dow  Jones Newswires  -- 5/25/01 
Muni power  -- Gov. Davis said he received a pledge Thursday from municipal utility  officials that their agencies will sell excess power to the state at prices much  lower than in the past. Despite simmering resentment at subjecting their  customers to rolling blackouts, the muni officials promised Davis they will keep  cooperating with the state. Municipal utility customers, including those in the  Modesto, Turlock and Merced irrigation districts, will continue to face power  blackouts, officials said afterward. Jim  Miller in the Modesto Bee   -- 5/25/01 
Edison merit raises -- Southern California Edison, which  is struggling to stay out of bankruptcy, will hand out $19 million in merit  raises to its 12,000 employees today, but top executives will forgo the raises  because of the company's financial woes. Edison has doled out hefty merit raises  in the past. But this year, the company will pay the minimum under its variable  compensation program, which rewards employees for meeting certain company goals.  Kate Berry in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01
Cities with own utilities ask FERC to bar blackouts -- More than 15 California cities  that have municipal utilities, including Anaheim, are asking federal regulators  to exempt them from electricity blackouts ordered by the state's Independent  System Operator. The city of Vernon was first to ask the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission to rule that the ISO cannot force it to participate in  California's rolling blackouts to serve demand in other areas. Vernon's utility  argued that it was ridiculous to subject its customers to blackouts when it had  enough power to keep the lights on. Amy Strahan  Butler in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01 
Utility tax windfall -- As electricity rates rise,  consumers will get hit with a double whammy because of an obscure utility bill  tax that many California cities have quietly been collecting for years. A member  of the state Board of Equalization charges that some cities will reap windfalls  from the utility user tax, and he is backing a grass-roots movement to slash or  repeal it. Few local governments are hurrying to forfeit the money, saying that  they need it to pay their own higher energy bills. Wendy  Thermos in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
An air of discontent over diesel backups -- Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday  that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage 3  electricity alerts as a way to stave off blackouts. And when blackouts do occur,  thousands of tractor-trailer-size generators will whir to life, powering  elevators and lights, hospital equipment, even assembly lines. But that prospect  has created major concerns. Most of those industrial- strength generators run on  diesel oil, a highly polluting fuel. Because they were intended for emergency  use, generators have escaped most environmental regulations. What's more, they  are likely to be called into service on the hottest, smoggiest days of the year.  Carolyn Said in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Power price controls -- The House Energy and Commerce  Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans  and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price  controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast. The negotiations  hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans' staunch opposition to  price controls. An earlier effort to include such controls in the bill turned  contentious and was defeated on a mostly partisan vote in subcommittee. Les Blumenthal in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
For seniors, the heat can kill, doctors warn -- As summer slouches toward  Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve electricity, doctors and  advocates for the elderly are sounding a counter-theme. Heat can kill. And most  often, it kills seniors. Year after year, heat waves around the United States  are deadlier than hurricanes or floods, tornadoes or earthquakes, according to  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver  Teichert in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Outages could be fatal for disabled -- Around the clock, an electric  pump supplies supplementary oxygen to 66-year-old Benny Pritchett's diseased  lungs. Pritchett worries that a rolling blackout might kill him. ""The  electricity goes out, I'm a dead man,"" said the San Bernardino apartment dweller  and former chain-smoker. ""I've got a (back-up) oxygen tank. It lasts two hours.  When it runs out, I'm dead."" Rolling blackouts aren't expected to last much more  than an hour, say Southern California Edison officials, but their Web site  recommends that any customer dependent on electrically operated life-support  equipment buy an emergency generator. Richard  Brooks in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Gasoline prices -- Average gasoline prices statewide are nearly $2 a gallon, and the Los  Angeles region has once again been dubbed the nation's hub of traffic  congestion. So, what's a good Southern Californian to do? Plan a road trip.  Hugo Martin in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Offshore drilling -- A federal advisory panel Thursday urged the Bush administration to  identify the five most promising areas to drill for natural gas in coastal  waters off California and other states, which have been off limits to drilling  for nearly 20 years. Citing the nation's unmet energy needs, the advisory group  to Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton suggested that locating the top reservoirs  of natural gas would help determine if there ""are grounds and support for a  limited lifting of"" moratoriums on offshore drilling. The ban now covers 610  million acres of ocean off the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Kenneth Weiss in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Judge demands straight answers from El Paso Corp. -- An irate judge threatened  yesterday to subpoena the president of a Texas energy firm accused of  manipulating California natural gas prices, saying he couldn't get straight  answers out of another high-ranking company executive. The eruption by Curtis  Wagner Jr., the administrative law judge presiding over a federal probe of  alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp., prompted the company to schedule  voluntary testimony by President William Wise today in Washington, D.C. Bernadette Tansey in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
El Paso executive and collusion -- The head of a Texas energy  conglomerate personally endorsed a deal between two subsidiaries accused of  manipulating the natural gas market in Southern California to drive up prices, a  senior official of the firm testified Thursday. The testimony in a trial-like  hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raised questions about  whether top officials of Houston-based El Paso Corp. violated FERC rules  requiring arm's-length dealings within a corporate family. The admission by El  Paso executive Ralph Eads marked a shift from his previous testimony and was  elicited through sharp questioning by an angry judge who threatened to subpoena  Eads' boss. Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Riverside no blackouts -- Southern California Edison won't  immediately challenge Riverside's decision against using rolling blackouts to  save energy this summer, a spokesman said Thursday. Edison doesn't care how the  city of Riverside curtails its energy use as long as the city makes the required  cuts during a statewide power shortage, Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said.  Dan Lee in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Energy crisis hits muni bonds -- Investors fled the California  municipal bond market last month, taking with them a net $3.5 billion, their  departure prompted in part by the state's energy crisis and taxes, a fund  analysis firm said Thursday. The withdrawals in April marked the worst such  outflow in years, and it comes as the state is preparing this August to issue a  record $13.4 billion in bonds to bail out utilities. Loretta Kalb in the Sacramento Bee   -- 5/25/01 
With a perfectly negative crisis record, Davis desperate for a  win -- So far, Gov. Gray Davis has amassed an unblemished record in  his handling of the energy crisis. Not one major aspect of the situation has  moved in the positive direction Davis said -- and clearly hoped -- it would, to  wit: Dan Walters in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Hot days don't cut the power -- A combination of factors kept the  state's beleaguered system out of the red this time. The heat wave didn't hit  all areas of the state at the same time, and cooler weather in the Pacific  Northwest got power flowing from that region to California again. Also, there  have been no new power-plant malfunctions, and many of the smaller generating  facilities that were AWOL a few weeks ago, when the last blackouts hit, are  operating again. A huge potential contributor to blackout avoidance -- but one  that's difficult to quantify -- is conservation. Jack  Katzanek in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Long Beach Boeing layoffs -- Reflecting a sagging market for  100-seat jetliners, the Boeing Co. will lay off about 600 employees this year at  its commercial factory in Long Beach, the company confirmed Thursday. That  decision followed an internal study by Boeing that was completed earlier this  year, said spokesman Warren Lamb, who did not elaborate. Ian Hanigan in the Long Beach Press  --  5/25/01 
Hahn --  His job is to both prosecute and defend. And with that tricky mandate, Los  Angeles City Atty. James Kenneth Hahn for 16 years has led a law office that, in  sheer numbers, would rank among the biggest in the country. With some 450  attorneys, responsibility for both criminal and civil cases, and an annual  budget of $70 million, the office, like the city it serves, is big, diverse,  complex. But a review of Hahn's record suggests that his performance has been  mixed--deliberate and plodding, pragmatic and obstinate. Greg Krikorian and Patrick  McGreevey in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Villaraigosa and Hahn and housing -- It doesn't fire up voters like a  stump speech on crime, schools or traffic congestion. But the sheer magnitude of  the city's housing shortage has placed it squarely--albeit quietly--on the  agendas of both candidates running for mayor of Los Angeles. Eight years of a  widely criticized lack of mayoral attention to the housing problem combined with  a high concentration of low-wage workers has earned Los Angeles a reputation as  one of the most unaffordable, overcrowded metropolitan centers in the country,  plagued by low home ownership rates and slum conditions. Lee Romney in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Villaraigosa and Hahn annd crime and gangs -- Mayoral candidates Antonio  Villaraigosa and City Attorney James Hahn continued Thursday to compare their  plans to deal with crime as they near the June 5 runoff election. Hahn, filing  papers in court to seek injunctions against two Wilmington gangs, touted his  efforts over the past several years to control gang activity throughout the  city. ""The root of the violence is drugs and ... for turf and control,"" Hahn  said of the two gangs -- but which, he added, applies to most gangs in the city.  Rick Orlov in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
Dean Andal  -- State Board of Equalization member Dean Andal is expected to announce today  that he plans to run for state controller next year. The 41-year-old Republican  from Stockton said he will run on a platform that includes lowering utility  taxes paid by residents and businesses in Los Angeles, which are 10% and 12.5%,  respectively. The story is in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Jim Rogan  -- President Bush on Thursday nominated former Congressman James Rogan to be  undersecretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the U.S.  Trademark Office. The job pays $130,200 a year. Bush's selection of Rogan, which  will require confirmation by the Senate, could be a positive sign for Hollywood,  which has been lobbying for increased enforcement of copyright laws, including a  crackdown on Internet piracy. Bill Hillburg in  the Los  Angeles Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
Living wage -- While attorneys speculated on the constitutionality of Santa Monica's  newly approved living wage law, hotel housekeeper Blanca Mendez was just hoping  Thursday that she can benefit if a raise to $10.50 an hour goes into effect next  summer at large downtown and beach-side businesses. ""It would be fantastic,""  said Mendez, who now earns $8.50 an hour after seven years at the Streamline  Moderne-style Shangri-La Hotel near the ocean. ""The economy is very difficult;  everything is getting expensive, like gas, like energy."" Oscar Johnson and Ofelia  Casillas in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
9 tribes' casino plans put on hold -- Gov. Gray Davis won't approve any  more agreements with Indian tribes to allow casinos until the federal courts  resolve a legal challenge to California's Indian gaming law. So far, the  governor's moratorium on new Indian gaming compacts, announced in a letter to  nine California tribes, doesn't appear to affect three Sonoma County tribes that  have announced plans for casinos. But it could delay the progress of the nine  other tribes that have asked the governor to negotiate gaming agreements,  including the Round Valley tribe in Mendocino County. Steve Hart in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5/25/01 
Charity foundations growth -- California's charitable  foundation assets--which were relatively modest as recently as two decades  ago--are now growing at a rate faster than those in the rest of the country,  according to a study by the new USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. In  1978, California held 8% of national foundation assets; in 1998 it accounted for  14%, the study said. During the same period, the state's share of foundation  grants grew from 7% to 11% of total giving nationwide, it said. ""California is  catching up and jumping forward,"" said Marcia K. Sharp, a research fellow at the  USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy, and a co-author of the study.  Anne-Marie O'Connor in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Documents seized in S.F. minority contract probe are  inadmissible -- In a  potential blow to prosecutors, a U.S. judge said that federal investigators  violated a San Francisco city official's privacy rights when they searched her  office looking for evidence of fraud in a city minority contracting program. The  FBI seized hundreds of pages of records from the San Francisco Human Rights  Commission office of chief contract compliance officer Zula Jones in August  1999. Chuck Finnie and Lance Williams in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Feinstein fast-tracks water storage plans -- California can't forestall a  water crisis without building more storage facilities, Sen. Dianne Feinstein  said yesterday in responding to environmental critics of her bill to reauthorize  the CalFed ecosystem restoration program. Eric Brazil in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Michael Gardner in the  San  Diego Union  -- 5/25/01 
Californians' recycling efforts hit skids -- Californians are recycling a  lower percentage of redeemable plastic, glass and aluminum beverage containers  than they have in more than a decade, the state Department of Conservation  reported Thursday. While officials note the recycling drop is partially due to  an increasing number of products available for redemption, they also point to  research suggesting consumers' habits may be slipping. Ed  Fletcher in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
UC admissions policy -- A UC Berkeley request to be  exempted from a University of California admissions policy is creating concern  among administrators and faculty who object to looking at one campus in  isolation. Instead, they said, the Berkeley request probably should be folded  into a systemwide review of admissions already under way. Tanya Schevitz in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Irvine cash crop: business -- Irvine One of the largest  commercial developments in the county could be built in the next five to seven  years, replacing checkered fields of strawberries and other crops. The 670 acres  of fields and a scattering of industrial buildings just outside Irvine's  northeastern border is large enough to host 12 Disneylands, but The Irvine Co.  has other plans. Laura Corbin, Jennifer Hieger  and Elizabeth Aguilera in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01 
Like a Rolling Tone -- It looked like a scene from the  hotel karaoke lounge, where the microphone-hogging guy won't stop belting Tom  Jones tunes and a few cocktail-sipping patrons keep their eyes glued to their  drinks in embarrassment. But it was official state business at the state Capitol  on Thursday when members of the Assembly attempted to pay tribute to Bob Dylan  on his 60th birthday by feebly singing along with his 1973 recording of ""Forever  Young."" Lesli A. Maxwell in the Fresno  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Joe Lockhart -- Barely six months after joining Oracle Corp. as a communications  consultant to chief executive Larry Ellison, former White House press secretary  Joe Lockhart has left the database software firm. Both sides yesterday denied a  rift between the two men and blamed Lockhart's frequent trips from his home in  Washington, D.C., to Oracle's Redwood Shores headquarters for the departure.  Kelly Zito in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 More..

I know you are quite busy but I wonder if you could get your lead trader to look the following forecast for NEEPOOL. This may result in you getting the lead for a large block of the power so be conservative but have enough in there so it is a win win if you know what I mean.
 
Have him fill in what he can. The client will be looking long 10 year, with maybe a series of 2 and 5 year deals. Should be putting out around 500 to 700 Mwe.
 
Do not disclose the plant eh ?
Call me at 864-370-0217 or 864-235-5607 or mobile 864-275-3193

9175,"Company Business, Strategy, etc.","SAN FRANCISCO -- A Texas energy executive who said his warnings were ignored by regulators who restructured California's electricity industry came to the Bay Area on Thursday to say, in effect, ""I told you so."" 
Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp., said that California wouldn't be in its current mess if regulators had followed his advice in 1994 and 1995. 
Regulators erred by forcing wholesale electricity transactions into the spot market so that deals could more easily be monitored, Skilling said in a speech to about 100 people at the Commonwealth Club of California. ""They created a flawed marketplace in the name of regulatory expediency."" 
Enron is a broker that buys and sells contracts to deliver power. Such bilateral transactions shouldn't have been banned, Skilling said. 
Skilling said that's what he said six years ago. 
""I probably made a pest of myself (in the restructuring hearings called by regulators) because I told them they were doing it wrong,"" he said. ""They finally told me to keep quiet."" 
On Thursday night, it was Skilling's turn to be pestered. A woman threw a chocolate pie into his face before the event began. Police said Francine Cavanaugh of Oakland was arrested on suspicion of battery and released. 
Skilling tried to ignore protesters but said he understood why Californians, facing blackouts and rising power costs, were angry. He even had kind words for Gov. Gray Davis, who, he said, ""was dealt a very difficult hand."" 
Skilling became Enron's chief executive in February, replacing company founder Kenneth Lay, an early proponent of electricity deregulation who is close to President Bush. 
Enron, a global energy giant with roots in the natural gas industry, owns some power plants, but its influence in the electricity industry reflects the rapid growth of its energy trading operation. 
Enron's only California generators are small wind facilities. However, the company has developed power plants. Enron initiated two 750-megawatt projects that were sold to Calpine Corp., including a Pittsburg plant due to go online next month. Enron has announced plans to seek regulators' approval for a 750-megawatt power plant in Roseville in Placer County. 
During the first three months of 2001, Enron posted a huge jump in revenue, to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion a year ago, but a much smaller gain in net income, to $425 million from $338 million. Skilling himself cashed an $850,000 paycheck and got a $5.6 million bonus last year. 
But the energy crisis has taken its toll on Enron's stock price and on Skilling, who owned or held options to buy 1.9 million shares of Enron common stock at the time of the company's February proxy filing. At Thursday's closing price of $44.05 a share, the stock was down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high of $90.75 in August. 
That proved that Enron wasn't the villain in California, Skilling said. ""This thing in California has been bad for everybody,"" he said. ""If we had anything to do with this, we're the stupidest people in the world.""

> A 1960 Moment
> Al Gore's selection of Joe Lieberman gives Democrats--and everyone
> else--something to cheer about.
> BY PEGGY NOONAN
> Monday August 7, 2000 4:26 p.m. EDT
> The choice of Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as Al Gore's running mate is so
> smart, so clever, so good, so satisfying, so striking that it just may
> turn
> this election a bit on its head for a while. Certainly its most immediate
> effect is going to be a successful Democratic convention next week in Los
> Angeles, because now the Democrats, badly hit by their own form of Clinton
> fatigue and acutely aware of the particular charmlessness of their
> presidential candidate, have something to cheer about. They respect Joe
> Lieberman. They think he has a center, a moral and ethical view of the
> world. He is experienced and articulate. He is decent and intelligent. He
> is
> independent. The media love him. He is a regular co-star on Imus, and all
> of
> the columnists and reporters for the elite newspapers, and all of the
> electronic pundits and anchors, know him and admire him.
> But that is not what is most wonderful. What is most wonderful is that he
> is
> an Orthodox Jew. What does this mean? It means a lot of people who love
> America more than they love parties or politics are happy that a big and
> great breakthrough has occurred. A friend, a journalist who is politically
> conservative and Jewish, e-mailed me to tell me he had been weeping all
> morning, that he'd cried when he heard the news. Another friend, a
> producer at a TV news show, called and told me she woke her father in
> California to give him the news and they both got choked up. ""This is like
> 1960,"" she said, and I said I know, and I got choked up. It is wonderful
> when America is at her most American, and breaks down another barrier and
> says ""What's in your heart is most important.""
> If Joe Lieberman had been Joe Lee, and an Episcopalian, Al Gore would have
> been smart to pick him. He would have been an obvious choice. The only
> reason he would have hesitated over Mr. Lieberman is that he's Jewish. Mr.
> Gore decided that was just fine. I think that I have never seen Al Gore do
> such an elegant, intelligent and original thing. Well done, Mr. Gore.
> I have to tell you, this really does feel like a 1960 moment to me. I was
> a
> little girl when a Catholic got chosen to run for president, and I had
> gathered from the conversation of grownups that You Don't Elect Catholics
> to the Presidency. When it happened, it's hard to describe how exciting
> and
> moving and idealism-inspiring it was. It gave a lot of people a lot of
> joy.
> It opened things up more. That was a good thing. So is this.
> And because this is such a good thing, I hope everyone of whatever
> politics
> or persuasion sits back for a few days and feels good about it. Everyone
> should be nice and not do any political bashing until . . . Friday.
> However, I think it's okay and maybe even helpful to note the following.
> Network producers are going to decide, in their bright and touchingly
> uninformed minds, that the big opponents of the Lieberman choice will be
> Christian conservatives. That's where they'll go for the negative sound
> bites. But Christian conservatives love Joe Lieberman. They've been arm in
> arm with him in the great cultural battles of the past decade. He was just
> about the only Democrat who'd give them the time of day. He was on their
> side.
> The last time I saw Mr. Lieberman was last spring, in New York, at a
> symposium on Hollywood and the culture. I moderated and introduced our
> guests--Joe Lieberman and Bill Bennett, who are close friends and
> co-warriors in the values battle. Lieberman and Bennett very frankly
> talked
> to the audience of producers and writers and network people and movie
> stars about how to make television and film and music more decent, more
> helpful.
> This is how people on the right think of and have experienced Mr.
> Lieberman--as a good guy with his head screwed on right.
> Many conservative Christians--I think most conservative Christians--see
> all
> of those who love God as part of the same ""cultural minority.""
> Conservative
> Christians don't feel they have much in common, in terms of their
> political
> desires, with atheists and agnostics and leftist Episcopalian bishops and
> such. But they think they have a great deal in common with Orthodox Jews.
> They crowd around Rabbi Daniel Lapin when he speaks at a conservative
> gathering; they crowd around Dennis Prager, Michael Medved, David Horowitz
> and scores of others. One of the biggest heroes of conservative Christians
> is an Orthodox Jew called Dr. Laura; the last time I saw her she was
> wowing them at a born-again Christian assembly at the National Prayer
> Breakfast last February.
> A powerful and respected political officeholder told me Monday that
> there's
> ""no upside"" to the Lieberman choice. I told him there's no downside. He
> was surprised and said, ""He can't even campaign on Saturdays!"" I said so
> what, America would love to see a politician who actually put God first
> one day a week.
> I wish I'd added this: Remember Sandy Koufax? Joe Lieberman not
> campaigning on Saturday is Sandy Koufax not pitching on Yom Kippur. There
> were a lot of great sports moments in the 1950s and 1960s, but none
> greater than the day in 1965 when Mr. Koufax put God before the World
> Series. What a great guy, what a lesson for a generation of Christian and
> Jewish kids. And Muslims and everyone else too.
> Yes, it's good news for Hillary. It's great news for Hillary. It enlivens
> part of her New York base, it says to New York Jews that the Democrats are
> the party that did this great thing, it excites people--and may help them
> forget, or at least not remember so vividly, that the Democratic
> senatorial
> candidate has, shall we say, a not fully satisfying relationship with New
> York's Jews. A historic choice like the Mr. Lieberman can overwhelm a lot
> of
> previous bad static.
> But let's not care about that for now. The headline is not ""Is It Good for
> Hillary?"" The headline is: ""It Is Good for America."" It is a wonderful
> country that does something like this, that takes a good man who is a
> member of a small ethnic/religious minority to be one of its two major
> vice
> presidential candidates, and that greets that choice with resounding
> hurrahs.
> This is really a great day. We should all be happy. We really are a
> maturing

I wanted to get back to you with a reply to your question about my  
recommendation on a patent attorney.  I cannot give you a personal  
recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to  
file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a  
trade secret or as a patented commodity.  I ultimately struck a compromise  
position by filing my own ""provisional patent application.""  This establishes  
the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent?  
or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it  
with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual  
property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys.  Of  
these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for  
your son's software idea.  He talked as though he had a particular specialty  
in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive.  He  
practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408)  
282-1856. 
I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to  
visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office.  Basic information and  
forms can be downloaded from there.  Two other, newer sites might also  
intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of  
intellectual property, patents, etc.  They are:

Call it NBC's ""Can't See TV."" 
""This is not some cheap rating ploy. ... If this works, they're gonna make us do this every night,"" Leno joked as part of his opening monologue. 
The nationally broadcast show, featuring a comic interlude with California Gov. Gray Davis, utilized just a small amount of electricity to run the cameras, Leno said before the show began. 
Actually, in Burbank, where the taping took place at NBC Studios, the city owns the power company and residents and businesses have not been hit by rolling blackouts as in other areas. The city made $5 million in profit in May after racking up $60 million in excess power sales. 
But Leno said not using studio lights, TV monitors, amplifiers and other power sources Thursday saved enough electricity to light a four-bedroom house for a month. 
Members of the house band wore miner's helmets, with group leader Kevin Eubanks strumming an acoustic guitar rather than his regular electric instrument. 
The stage was lit by candles, torches and flashlight beams trained on Leno. Members of the studio audience used the gear to help brighten the set. 
""This is real goofy,"" Leno said before taping got under way. ""We'll see what happens."" Guests included Arsenio Hall, Gilbert Gottfried, a trainer of nocturnal animals and a Hawaiian fire dancer -- and a brief visit from the governor. 
Exuding whatever is the direct opposite of charisma, Davis had a brief exchange with Leno, drawing laughs with the line, ""This is the first time Gray Davis and (the word) electricity have ever appeared in the same sentence."" 
Leno's staff wore glasses with small lights attached and audience prompter Bob Perlow held a hand-scrawled applause sign aloft throughout the show instead of switching on the usual electric model. 
While there was little energy in play, there was no shortage of laughs. 
Leno joked that President George W. Bush told Davis not to worry because, ""I've been operating in the dark for years."" 
Those in the studio said Leno's nocturnal transmission added excitement to the program. 
""It was cool,"" said Lillie Harrell, 17, a tourist from Hammond, La. ""The crowd got really involved. I guess it shows you don't really need all those lights."" 
Added Jose Tano, 21, a Burbank resident and student at the University of California, Los Angeles, ""It was a good idea and a great way to make a point."" 
The local power company might not have made out very well, but the studio audience didn't end up empty-handed. Each received a fluorescent lantern and pack of batteries as they left the studio.

174394,Personal but in professional context,"Today, I spoke with EPSA's outside counsel, Andy Zausner, about having his 
firm's Senior Counsel former Senator Wendell Ford (D-Ky, 1974-98) assist us 
with our FERC ""Linda Breathitt"" Strategy.  Former Senator Ford knew Linda's 
father well plus has dinner with Linda every several weeks or so.  There 
probably isn't anyone in Washington closer to Linda than Wendell as he has 
known her since she was a child.  Andy is expecting either Steve's or Rick's 
phone call to further discuss the Senator's involvement.  Andy did discuss in 
general that he wasn't certain whether his client, EPSA, would go along with 
the strategy but he thought, overall, it was a possibility.  Andy's direct 
number is 202-828-2259.  I know Andy and Wendell very well and would like to 
be helpful as you wish.  However, at this point, I thought an EPSA board 
member (i.e. Steve or Rick) should follow up.  thanks."

Jeff and the Governor to talk (because of the Governor's schedule).  We'll 
try to set something up later.  In the meantime, the Governor should just 
sign the bill.  Of course, Hettie had already communicated this; the Gov's

before or in the morning of the second (to do this though he would have to 
cancel his speech to the Texas Governor's business council but he is willing 
to do this if necessary)

175580,Logistic Arrangements,"Steve: 
Thanks for your note, sorry I missed you.  From your message I think there 
may be some miscommunication between your PR guys and us.  We understood that 
your PR people wanted to reprint the Op-ed and redistribute it to 
as-yet-undetermined people, along with various Enron material.  They also 
wanted to post it on Enron's public web site.
But your message seemed to indicate you just want to post the op-ed on your 
intranet -  for educational use only for your internal folks.  If this is 
correct, we would have no problem with it. In fact, we have posted the op-ed 
on the CERA web page - which is theoretically available to every Enron 
employee for internal use only.  If you want you could just post a link to 
the CERA web site so your people could get direct access to all our research 
on the topic.
If I misunderstood you, and you do want to redistribute the piece to 
third-parties -- that is a much bigger issue because it involves our 
intellectual property and  branding issues.  Obviously, we would need to talk 
some more about this.  I hope this helps.
On a somewhat-related note, we are also getting sucked more and more into the 
California vortex, and being asked to help in areas that are not our 
traditional business, such as expert witness testimony and policy issues.  
While we are not afraid to take a point of view (as you know!) we must 
maintain a neutral and independent posture.  This is sometimes a difficult 
path to navigate, but we are exploring two areas that may also interest Enron:
1. We have examined Joskow and FERC's analysis on the price gouging issue and 
we believe there are several major flaws in their methodologies.  We are 
considering how best to broadcast our assessment, without impinging on our 
core business, or becoming an expert witness.  We think a workshop, similar 
to the Monday event at CERAWeek could work, where we would present our 
findings and issue a report.
2. We are also looking into the economic impact of power outages in the West 
- especially linked to the overall fragile state of the US economy.  This 
would be a collaborative effort with a major economic forecasting firm or 
university.  Again the reults would go to our clients, but could be released 
to a wider audience, and a workshop might help highlight the release.
Please let us know if either topic would be of interest to Enron.  We would 
need to raise funding from various clients to help underwrite the effort , 
but the work would be CERA's independent research and we would stand fully 
behind it.
Hope all is well. ...Peter

attributable to your lobbying activities rather I just need an allocation of 
your time/hours spent engaging in such activity during the year 2000.  I 
apologize for any confusion.  Thank you - Tara Rafter"

their system because James Derrick (whom all the previous invoices have been 
sent) said that he is not the person to approve the payment. The accountant 
asked me whom he sould direct the invoice to. Please let me know your

It is conceivable that I could get out tomorrow, but I am wondering if I 
should try.  I could still make the speech if we don't get more rain, but 
given the lack of other reasons for me to go, I am considering cancelling.  I 
don't think it makes much sense for me to go for a 15 minute speech.

Good news.  As you indicated would happen, Kalen Pieper called me mid-week.  We had a very good conversation about EES and Dave Delainey's leadership.  She explored my views about doing business with government.  Shortly thereafter, Dave's office called to invite me to Houston on Thursday July 26.  
 
Kay Chapman explained that Dave's schedule would keep him out of pocket until August 16.  In order to move forward, Janet Dietrich will be meeting with me when I go to Houston next Thursday.  (I must confess that after all the great things I have heard about the man, I do look forward to meeting Dave himself.)
 
Is there a time next week that I can speak with you by phone to fine-tune my thinking / preparation for Thursday's meeting with Janet?
 
Thank you for your all of your help.  I am pleased and appreciative that things are moving forward at a good clip.  
 
Kevin

Subject:  Confidential Information and Securities Trading
 
To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading activities, Enron Wholesale Services (""EWS"") has recently revised its official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and Securities Trading (""Policies and Procedures""). These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the ""Review Team"" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the ""Resource Group"" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:
 
<http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp>
 
If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so within two weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with your SAP Personal ID number. If you have any questions concerning the Policies or Procedures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna Lowry at extension 3-1939. "

Lizzette. Would you mind getting with Diane on the isue of online harassment prevention training?  We have been looking into that form of delivering training. Diane has info from Littler on its proposed training. I think that the costs may be high, but I would like your evaluation of The product. Would you mind taking the lead on this?  Obviously, this is not an issue with huge time sensitivity. Thanks. Michelle

Hello!
 
Just a friendly reminder that tomorrow all   presentations are due as I will be in and out of the office for the rest of the  week at the Asset and Liability Management conference.  
 
If your presentations are not ready, for whatever  reason, please send me an email to notify me and I will send you a headcount as  to how many copies of your presentations to print.  You will need to take  them to the training course yourself.  
 
Please remember that you will need to bring your  own laptops as we do not provide them.  Spyros, I believe you are to  inquire with Peter to see if you can use his.  
 
Also, I am under the impression that the  presentations submitted for the London training course, will be the same ones to  be used in the New York and Houston Financial Mathematics training  courses.  Please correct me if I am wrong and let me know by when you will  have presentations ready for those particular courses in those  locations.
 
Should you have any questions or comments, please  feel free to contact me.
 
All the best and I look forward to meeting you  soon.
 
Joanna

Good Morning, Vince!
 
I spoke with Iris last week about something she had submitted to you.  It's about the various models that we've created in the department.  She said that it goes into details we may not want to publicize, but that it might be adaptable for the newsletter.  There's an introductory section, a models section, and recommendations for the future.  I would suggest that we run the introduction, amend the models section to eliminate anything we don't want to say, and omit the final portion.
 
If you are agreeable, I can use all or part of the introduction in today's issue and split up the rest.  It would give us a breather while others are finishing their submissions.  
 
What do you think?

I understand how awfully busy you must all be at  this time, but I would appreciate a phone call or a quick email to confirm  that you ahve or have not, for that matter received the speaker packets I sent  to you May 2, 2001.  please advise as soon as possible, that way, if yo  have not, for whatever received them, I will know what steps to take from  there.
 
All the best.

Good news.  As you indicated would happen, Kalen Pieper called me mid-week.  We had a very good conversation about EES and Dave Delainey's leadership.  She explored my views about doing business with government.  Shortly thereafter, Dave's office called to invite me to Houston on Thursday July 26.  
 
Kay Chapman explained that Dave's schedule would keep him out of pocket until August 16.  In order to move forward, Janet Dietrich will be meeting with me when I go to Houston next Thursday.  (I must confess that after all the great things I have heard about the man, I do look forward to meeting Dave himself.)
 
Is there a time next week that I can speak with you by phone to fine-tune my thinking / preparation for Thursday's meeting with Janet?
 
Thank you for your all of your help.  I am pleased and appreciative that things are moving forward at a good clip.  
 
Kevin

employees went through the PRC process in 2000.  I am not sure this is 
accurate.  It's fair to say that most did, but I believe that the field

Regarding voicemail I left you regading my current compensation, I  do not 
intend to bug you about this, but at some point, I would appreciate knowing 
whether my  base compensation ( and stock compensation  given recent price

public affairs, company, and externally. Thanks.
"
175560,Status arrangements,
175721,Status arrangements,"As for our search, using Korn Ferry, I have narrowed the field to two very 
good candidates.   I am setting up time for Rick to interview these 
candidates next Monday.  The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep. Tom 
Delay's office.  Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican 
leadership circles, seems trustworthy, and capable of learning most of the 
substance of the energy portfolio.  Drew has strong networking skills, which 
I think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills.  The 
second candidate is John Shelk, whom I have known for nearly 15 years.  John 
was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee 
under Norm Lent.  John left the Committee in 1992.  Since then John has 
worked in the financial services and gaming industries, where he has enhanced 
his political and Republican networking skills.  John in very short order 
would have extremely strong technical skills, atlhough he has been away from 
the industry for eight years.  I believe both candidates bring different but 
very strong talents to the job.  I have a second opening for an enviromental 
advocate.  I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we could 
redirect one of these candidates (probably John) to that slot.   That said, 
please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew.

I don't know if he went to Valeria. Lizzette, why don't you call her to find out status. I still think that termination this quickly after he raised discrim claims is a bit risky but if he is not doing his job then I think we should document it well and communicate with his agency to have it tell him that he must be there.

Hi Vince,
 
I just thought I'd check in to see if you had resolved  your space issue for your analysts.  If so, I would love to send you some  people to consider for your team!  
 
Hope your summer is going well and that you are surviving all  the rain!  I recently spent a week rafting through the Grand  Canyon...an adventure I would highly recommend.
 
Hope to hear from you!

Dear Jeff
 
There aren't any ""corporate speak"" words that can express what I feel, so I will use plain English:  I am thrilled that I will be working for you at Enron.  I look forward to helping you and your team continue to transform Enron into the number one company in the world and into the best company in the world.
 
I have sent my bio to Steve Kean and will send him my list of my preferred California contacts.  By mid-week, I will send you a cleaned-up version of the suggestions I outlined in our meeting.
 
I look forward to the next steps.  It is an honor to be working with you again.  I pledge to you my very best.
 
Sincerely,

We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets."

140836,Document editing/checking,"If we cancel the turbine contract and do not go forward with Pastoria, the 
dollar amount of the credits vested in CCSI  and exercisable after December 
31,2000, are equal to the Development Funds advanced less the refund amount.  
Since the document now reads that the $2.1 refund amount goes back to West LB 
or its designee, if GE pays the refund and CCSI is holding a  Xonon credit of 
only $7.8 million,it seems to me it will be necessary  to pay the refund over 
to CCSI instead of ENA in order to make up for the fact that it paid $9.9 in 
premium and only received $7.8 in credit in September. This quick 
""liquidation"" of $2.1 of the credit seems to be an ancillary benefit to CCSI 
occasioned by GE's refund. We could provide in the agreements that GE makes 
this payment directly to CCSI or we can continue to have the right to receive 
the payment from GE under the XTIA and the obligation to pay it to CCSI under 
the Repurchase Agreement."

This is a draft of the contact  list I promised you.  There are still some typos in it.  I will clean  them up and get send you a draft in the morning that is ready for  circulation.
 
This list is made up  of people that I know and trust.  By an large I have excluded  sitting pubic officials.  In cases where a given organization has several  useful contacts with similar knowledge, I have listed just one person for  now.
 
Give me a call at your  convenience, and we can discuss this in great detail.
