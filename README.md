This project is an analysis of the Enron email dataset, which is part of an interview process. The Enron email dataset consists of approximately 500,000 emails from 150 users within the Enron corporation. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the communication patterns and behavior of the employees at Enron through analysis of their emails. For our use case we will be working with the "A subset of about 1700 labelled email messages".

# Data
The Enron email dataset is available on various online platforms. The data is in the form of text files, with each file representing an email. The dataset also includes metadata for each email, such as the sender, recipient, date, and subject.

# Tools and Methods
For this project, we will be using Python programming language and its libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform data pre-processing, visualization, and analysis.

## Analysis
The analysis of the Enron email dataset will be carried out in the following steps:

### Data Pre-processing: 
Clean and process the data to prepare it for analysis.
### Data Visualization: 
Use various visualizations to gain insights into the data, such as distribution of email frequency, email traffic, and relationships between employees.
### Data Analysis: 
Analyze the communication patterns of the employees, including email frequency, subject, and recipients.
# Conclusion
The analysis of the Enron email dataset provides valuable insights into the communication patterns and behavior of the employees at Enron. The findings of this project can be used to support future research on the topic and to gain a deeper understanding of organizational communication.
