This project is an analysis of the Enron email dataset, which is part of an interview process. The Enron email dataset consists of approximately 500,000 emails from 150 users within the Enron corporation. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the communication patterns and behavior of the employees at Enron through analysis of their emails. For our use case we will be working with the "A subset of about 1700 labelled email messages".
